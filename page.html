        The integration of the Telegram Bot API is an essential aspect of modern communication technologies. With the
        rapid evolution of messaging platforms, maintaining compatibility and functionality with these APIs is crucial
        for developers. By utilizing autogenerated code, developers can streamline the integration process and ensure
        that their applications remain up-to-date with the latest API changes. This approach not only saves time and
        effort but also promotes scalability and flexibility in bot development. With tools like tg-codegen, developers
        can efficiently manage API updates and focus on enhancing the user experience of their Telegram bots.
